# cf-prompt-cli-plugin
A Cloud Foundry CLI plugin that lets developers deploy code revisions directly from natural language prompts. 
Run prompts as CF tasks, generate new code revisions via AI agents, and push them seamlessly—keeping the 
simplicity and spirit of Cloud Foundry’s “I do not care how” philosophy.
